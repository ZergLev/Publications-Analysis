Analyzing publications on the topic of "drone detection"

Sending various queries to Google Patents with keywords on the topic of "drone
detection". Then sorting the publications by quarters and making graphs. Afterwards, comparing the differences in accuracy.

Results: Checking only titles for this particular topic is more accurate and changes the answer to whether the topic is currently growing in relevance or not. Adding the 'abstracts' column from the publications to the searched spots changes things slightly overall, but rather significantly for the task I mentioned. There are many patents about drones being used to do something remotely and since all drones have the function of identifying what's around them, having the keyword "identifying" could be detrimental to overall accuracy. But it's unlikely it will be used in a title, therefore the noticeable difference, in my opinion.

Using Python, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.
